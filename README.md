# HalPal
Create automatic color palettes using Halton sequences in CIE L*a*b* color space.

Halton sequences (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halton_sequence) are sequences of coordinates with 
low discrepancy, i.e. they are spread out "as evenly as possible". HalPal uses such sequences in a 
color space to create well balanced palettes of highly distinct colors. The user can define the 
range of subspace coordinates manually in order to avoid palettes that are too chaotic and unpleasing 
to the eye.
